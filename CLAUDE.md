# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Build/Test/Lint Commands
- Build: `hatch build`
- Lint: `hatch run ruff:check` or `hatch run ruff:fix` to auto-fix
- Tests: `hatch run test:test` or `hatch run test:cov` for coverage
- Single test: `pytest tests/path/to/test_file.py::TestClass::test_function -v`
- Type check: `hatch run mypy:check`

## Code Style Guidelines
- Formatting: Uses ruff for formatting and linting
- Imports: Standard lib first, third-party next, project imports last
- Types: Use typing annotations (e.g., `import typing as t`) for all functions
- Naming: CamelCase for classes, snake_case for functions/variables, UPPER_CASE for constants
- Error handling: Use ValueError for validation errors, custom exceptions for specific cases
- Documentation: Use Google-style docstrings for classes and methods
- Organization: Follow modular design with clear separation of concerns
- Testing: Create unit tests with appropriate markers (unit, integration, performance)
